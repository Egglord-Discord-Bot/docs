# Understanding the project!

Want to host the bot yourself, if not [invite him](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=647203942903840779&permissions=8&scope=bot)?

>Support will only be given on errors done by the base source code. (No edits to the code.)

### Setting up server
* The system you are using to host on must have a minimum version [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14. (It will not run at all if less).
* If you are hosting the lavalink aswell on the same system, it will need [Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) v11+ (v13 is preferred) and if not on the same system you will need to get the IP and port of the server. (This may require editing of application.yml)
* (Optional) You can also host the [mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) database on your system but this is optional.
